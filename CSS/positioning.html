Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents 
designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such
 as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
 and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
 originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
